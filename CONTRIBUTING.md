Hello, thanks for contributing to my absolute mess of code :)

Some rules:

- If the additions involve numbers taken from the official osu, try to include comments with links to where you found the numbers (for example, to a section in the wiki or to a line in the github repo).
- If UI is added, make sure it also works on mobile devices.
- Make sure to format and lint the code. The project has Pretter and ESLint, whose extensions you can get on VS Code.
- Make sure it builds successfully using `npm run build`.
